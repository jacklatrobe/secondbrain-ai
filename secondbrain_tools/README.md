# SecondBrain Tools

This directory contains the modular tool components that allow the LangChain agents in the SecondBrain application to interact with various search services, APIs, or data sources.

These tools are designed to be flexible and modular, enabling the agents to perform a wide variety of tasks such as information retrieval, data processing, and integration with external services.

## Structure

Each tool is contained within its own sub-directory, which includes the necessary Python files and any additional resources required by the tool.

## Adding New Tools

New tools can be added by creating a new sub-directory and implementing the necessary functionality in a Python script. Please follow the guidelines provided in the "Contributing" section of the main README to ensure compatibility with the existing system.

## Using Tools

The tools in this directory can be imported and used by the LangChain agents in the Manager, Editor, and Researcher directories. Please refer to the documentation in each tool's sub-directory or python file for usage details.
